# Super-Resolution of Images Using Deep Learning GANs with Modern Techniques
## 1. Introduction
This project aims to apply a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to the problem of image super-resolution. Given a low-resolution image, the goal is to upscale it to a high-resolution version, enhancing the quality and visual detail. This is achieved through the use of a Generator network that upscales the image and a Discriminator network that distinguishes between real high-resolution images and the ones generated by the Generator.
## 2. Project Overview
The project leverages deep learning models, specifically GAN-based architectures, for the super-resolution task. The code provided can be broken into key components that define the architecture, data processing, training procedure, and model saving/loading mechanisms.
